# analysis_of_the_service_database_for_reading_books_by_subscription

**Project goal**

Analyze the database. It contains information about books, publishers, authors, as well as user reviews of books. This data will help formulate the value proposition for the new product.

**Tasks**

* Count how many books were published after January 1, 2000;
* For each book, count the number of reviews and the average rating;
* Determine the author with the highest average book rating - only count books with 50 or more ratings;
* Identify the publishing house that published the largest number of books thicker than 50 pages - this way you will exclude brochures from the analysis;
* Calculate the average number of reviews from users who have given more than 50 ratings.

  
The DBMS used is PostgreSQL.
